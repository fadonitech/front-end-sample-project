# 3D CUSTOMIZABLE MOCKUPS FOR E-COMMERCES

This project is live and you can access [right here](https://fadonitech.com/).

## Description & Goals

This project was created with the purpose of becoming a product to e-commerce owners. Essentially, the main goal of this project was to
validate a potential market segment. **This application depends on two other projects, one of them is the back-end and the other is the dashboard**. The former can be found [right here](https://github.com/). And, the latter, the Business Intelligence software used to analyze the data, is unfortunately not available to the public inasmuch as it contains sensitive data of our previous users.

So, you might expect the following features from the website:

- Display a 3D element on the screen.
- Make the 3D element editable.
- Collect E-mails.
- Record user experience.
- Generate a heat map.
- Collect feedback from users.
- Write/Delete/Edit Blog Posts.

## What did Henry do?

As the owner of the project, I was responsible for:

- Create the Design - ( Mockups, Wireframes, User Interface, and Analyze User Experience).
- Develop this entire application and the other 2 supporting apps ( Backend and Dashboard ).
- Create/Analyze/Coordinate Pipelines, Goals, and Scrum/Kanban.
- Recruit/Coordinate Copywrites to create blog posts.
- Create the Script and recruit/manage an animator to create the video ad.
- Create/Analyze/Coodinate marketing campaigns in Google Ads and Adwords.

## Technologies

This web app had many versions each one separated in a specific branch. So, this project is built with the latest 
technologies in the industry, it's composed of:

- NextJS
- Javascript ES8+
- CSS / SASS
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- ThreeJS
- AWS EC2, S3, Amplify, Lambda
- Google Analytics
- Google Pixel
- Heatmap

## Outcome

On a product management stand point, this project was a complete success, we had several users signing up for the beta and a couple of investors interested in the main application. Also, an invitation to participate in an Accelerator program in New York was received. I had meetings, feedbacks, and even pitch decks. However, I failed to create traction, users were more interested in testing for trials than actually for paying a monthly subscription. Additionally, there was a few limitation on the technology I was using. For instance, users were unable to add/resize/manipulate photos into the 3D models and WebGL could only do so much. Thus, because of that and many other reasons, I had to close this application out.
