  "content": "<p>In 2020 the world shifted from a mix of physical and online to entirely digital. However, most of us have realized the internet has become extremely noisy and polluted with cheap ads and thousands of businesses. So, how can we change the game to our side?</p><p>In this article, we will be targeting how we can stand out from the competition. If you're not already creating content on social ( TikTok, Youtube, LinkedIn ), I would highly recommend beginning! Acquiring traction in this digital market is only possible by achieving a position of guide in your industry.</p><p>First of all, you must have a website, and we don't mean a cheap WordPress or standard template Shopify Store with hard to read text. People are tired of looking over and over again at the same site structure, and it's time for a change. Otherwise, your online presence might be judged doubtful, or even worse a \"scam\".</p><p>Second of all, professionalism is key that bad User Experience has to go. We're in a time where we need to be practical. Moreover, we need to reduce the barriers that our clients have to go through to acquire our product. For example, if you're in the consulting or healthcare business, replace that old e-mail form with an actual calendar form! There're thousands of APIs out there, even free ones. Use them to your advantage!</p><p>Third of all, quality is a must-have. We can have the best product ever and the coolest looking website. If it's slow, we already lost. We can't express enough the importance of software development!  If your web or mobile application is consistently giving people a hard time, they'll not use it.</p><p>Last but not least, be straightforward!! The average user will look at your website for 5 seconds, can you believe it? 5 seconds! If at first glance it is not obvious what you do and how you do it, people will be confused and eventually close your site.</p><p>A first impression is everything in a digital world. Facebook pages and LinkedIn profiles can only do so much. We're in an era we need to bring value to clients even before they buy our product. If you own a small shop, create content on your website, social media, and have an amazing first impression. I bet it'll stand out from the crowd!</p>"
