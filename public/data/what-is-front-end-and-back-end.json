  "content": "<p>What's the difference between Front-End and Back-End?</p><p>Since software development is a vast topic, we always use weird code names that segment software in specific fields. And that's why software development can get hard to get your head around!</p><p>We use terms like Front-End, Back-End, or Full-Stack to determine which area a programmer works. Translating to English, \"Font-End\" basically means that a developer works on the interactive part of the software where clients are directly in contact with, for example, a landing page. On the contrary,\"Back-End\" means someone that works on the \"back of the business\". The part the clients don't interact with, for instance, the database.</p><p>Confused already?</p><p>Honestly, software is just like a House! The architecture with the outstanding interior and amazing view is the interactive part of your house, Front-End, while the plumbing and heat is your Back-End. So, basically, the architects are the Front-End Developers while the Engineers are probably the Back-End programmers.</p><p>But, what about \"Full-Stack\"? It means someone is comfortable doing both! It may sound funny, but they are just like engineers that can decorate well!</p><p>You might be wondering, can they be extremely good at doing both parts? The simple answer is probably no. Full-Stack Developers might have a field of expertise since technologies vary drastically from one end to another. Some people feel more comfortable in the Back, others in the Front. But, honestly, they can get most of the job done when it comes to software development!</p><p>If you have in mind developing a large mobile or web application, I would definitely take into account the budget. Honestly, we would highly recommend hiring different specialists to deal with Front-End and Back-End. Even though Full-Stack developers may sound very attractive, they most often lack a deep understanding of both areas. It goes without saying, technology evolves quickly, and not all Full-Stacks out there maybe update with all the trends in both industries.</p><p>With all of that said, I hope we clarified a few points that you might need. Managing a technology team is no easy task. So, I wish you the best of luck in your journey of entrepreneurship and software development! Keep following our blog for more handy insights!</p>"
